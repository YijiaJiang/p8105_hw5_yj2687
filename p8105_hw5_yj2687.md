# Problem 1 (Longitudinal Study)

 

# Problem 2 (Homicide Dataset)

``` r
# Import dataset
homicide_raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

-   The raw data collected by Washington Post reports a total of 52179
    criminal homicides over the past decade in 50 of the largest
    American cities, including 12 variables, namely uid, reported_date,
    victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex,
    city, state, lat, lon, disposition.
-   The reported date, longitude and latitude are designated as numeric
    variables, and the remaining 9 variables including age, are defined
    as characters.
-   We can observe some entries for the victim’s race, age, and sex are
    reported as unknown.
-   There exist 60 missing values in `lat`, 60 in `lon`, accounting for
    0.11%, 0.11%, respectively.
-   In particular, there was one record from the city of `Tulsa`, which
    is located in the state of `OK`, was incorrectly logged as being in
    the state of `AL`, which will be removed as a typo.

``` r

    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
    )) %>% 
  relocate(city_state) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL")
