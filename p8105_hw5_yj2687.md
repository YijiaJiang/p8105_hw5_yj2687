# Problem 1 (Longitudinal Study)

 

# Problem 2 (Homicide Dataset)

``` r
# Import dataset
homicide_raw <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"))
```

-   The raw data collected by Washington Post reports a total of 52179
    criminal homicides over the past decade in 50 of the largest
    American cities, including 12 variables, namely uid, reported_date,
    victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex,
    city, state, lat, lon, disposition.

``` r
# Clean dataset and create variables city_state, resolved
homicide_df = homicide_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(reported_date = as.Date(as.character(reported_date), format = "%Y%m%d")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
    )) %>% 
  relocate(city_state) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL")


# Summarize within cities to calculate the total number of homicides and unsolved homicides
summary_hom_df = homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
